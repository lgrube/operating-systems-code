In this assignment, you should firstly read the code of RR.c, RR1.c RR2.c and RR3.c.
These are all the applications using Round Robin scheduling algorithm.

Please write a program to print a series of number from 1 to m, with n threads.
Each thread print one number at a time.
The thread run in a round robin fashion.

Firstly, you should ask the user to input the value of m and n .( You can read RR3.c to learn how.)
For example, if input : n = 10, m = 100

Sample output :
Thread-1:1
Thread-2:2
Thread-3:3

Thread-1:10
Thread-2:11
Thread-3:12
....

Thread-10:20
Thread-1:21
...
...
Thread-10:100
