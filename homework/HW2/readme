    First lab  assignment

Previously, we use gcc to compile your C programs.
But this goes tedious and complicated as we use more files in C programming.

At lab1, we have learned how to write our own makefile to help us.

In this assignment, you are provided two files, one is PascallTriangle.c,  and the other is main.c.
This program will ask the use to input an integer for the tiangle size. (<=15)  and print out the triangle on the screen .

In this assignment, you are expected to finish the Makefile.

There are detailed requirement for this MakeFile:
1: the final generated file is "main" .
    meaning that, after running your Makefile script, I can simply type
    $./main   
    and the output will be shown on screen.
2:  please make sure that grader can type
    $make all   
    to test your submission.

3:  Please  write a clean target (for $make clean) to remove your binaries. 
 

If above is new to you, please see our lab1 materials. 
   1) my class notes on Piazza, 2) your codes that was written at class ,and 3) my Github for all class codes.
